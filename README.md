**Instructions for use**

The `BrailleASCII` class takes user input through the command line for translation between braille, ASCII, and Unicode. The `BrailleAsciiTables` class contains the main methods for translation of singular characters. The `BitTree` and `BitTreeNode` classes contain the basis for the bit trees used to store the translation tables in `BrailleAsciiTables`.
